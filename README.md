# Hub 4 Restored Game Files

 The required edited game files for my hub 4 restored mod for Ty 1, just have this git repo to have a source control with the game files too

To use the files just put the PC_External folder into the same folder as the game, while using the PC_External loader plugin [https://github.com/ElusiveFluffy/PC_External-Loader](https://github.com/ElusiveFluffy/PC_External-Loader) and the hub 4 restored plugin [https://github.com/ElusiveFluffy/Hub-4-Restored](https://github.com/ElusiveFluffy/Hub-4-Restored)

For an actual release I'll most likely put it into a Patch_PC.rkv instead.
